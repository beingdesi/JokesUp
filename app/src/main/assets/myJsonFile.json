They also implemented a new performance system that would give the 1 person rowing the boat greater incentive to work harder. It was called the Rowing Team Quality First Program, with meetings, dinners and a free pen for the rower. We must give the rower the empowerment and enrichments through this quality program.\r\n \r\nThe next year the Japanese won by two miles.

Never use \"fine\" to describe how a woman looks - this will cause you to have one of those arguments.\r\n\r\nFIVE MINUTES\r\n\r\nThis is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so it's an even trade.\r\n\r\nNOTHING\r\n\r\nThis means \"something,\" and you should be on your toes. \"Nothing\" is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside down, and backwards. \"Nothing\" usually signifies an argument that will last \"Five Minutes\" and end with \"Fine\"\r\n\r\nGO AHEAD (With Raised Eyebrows!)\r\n\r\nThis is a dare. One that will result in a woman getting upset over \"Nothing\" and will end with the word \"Fine\"\r\n\r\nGO AHEAD (Normal Eyebrows)\r\n\r\nThis means \"I give up\" or \"do what you want because I don't care\" You will get a \"Raised Eyebrow Go Ahead\" in just a few minutes, followed by \"Nothing\" and \"Fine\" and she will talk to you in about \"Five Minutes\" when she cools off.\r\n\r\nLOUD SIGH\r\n\r\nThis is not actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A \"Loud Sigh\" means she thinks you are an idi*t at that moment, and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over \"Nothing\"\r\n\r\nSOFT SIGH\r\n\r\nAgain, not a word, but a non-verbal statement. \"Soft Sighs\" mean that she is content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe, and she will stay content.\r\n\r\nTHAT'S OKAY\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can make to a man. \"That's Okay\" means that she wants to think long and hard before paying you back for whatever it is that you have done. \r\n\"That's Okay\" is often used with the word \"Fine\" and in conjunction with a \"Raised Eyebrow.\"\r\n\r\nGO AHEAD!\r\n\r\nAt some point in the near future, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.\r\n\r\nPLEASE DO\r\n\r\nThis is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance with the truth, so be careful and you shouldn't get a \"That's Okay\".\r\n\r\nTHANKS\r\n\r\nA woman is thanking you. Do not faint. Just say you're welcome.\r\n\r\nTHANKS A LOT\r\n\r\nThis is much different from \"Thanks.\" A woman will say, \"Thanks A Lot\" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you have offended her in some callous way, and will be followed by the \"Loud Sigh.\" Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the \"Loud Sigh,\" as she will only tell you \"Nothing\".","category":"other"},{"id":"vFmXe","title":"Aerobic Instructors","story":"Q: How many aerobics instructors does it take to change a lightbulb?\r\n \r\nA: Five.
